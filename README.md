# movies-list

A demo WebApp built with Vite, VueJS 3, Typescript and Sass that lets you view, add, edit and delete movies that are saved in your browser's localStorage.
You can view this webapp deployed on [Netlify](https://mv-movies-list.netlify.app/).

You can check on the Github actions how I configured Vitest to run some simple CRUD tests.
